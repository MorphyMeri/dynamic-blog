What happens when too many unexpected users hit your application and your server(s) are not ready
for that huge load. This results in downtime of your application, downtime which undoubtedly means
huge loss to your business.
</p>
<p class="blog-content">The above graph illustrates that as the user load on the application increased more than the application
could handle, response time also increased heavily, application throughput came down all of a sudden
and the /resources got fully saturated resulting in application downtime.</p>
<p class="blog-content">Just understand, the end users will not wait more than 2 seconds if the application (web/mobile) takes
time to respond. They will immediately choose an alternative; it can be your competitor.</p>
<p class="blog-content">To avoid this situation for your business solutions, it's always recommended to seek various perform performance testing tools and check the application with the expected or peak load. Few important factors to consider are:</p>
<ul class="blog-content">
<li>Check how well does the application scale?</li>
<li>Will it be able to handle the expected/ peak load with respective SLA?</li>
<li>Check where does the application break?</li>
<li>And are the /resources sufficient to handle the peak load?</li>
</ul>
<p class="blog-content">Know <a href="https://www.frugaltesting.com/blog/jmeter-how-to-distribute-user-load-in-the-test-plan">how to distribute user load on a test plan </a> using a throughput controller.</p>
<p class="blog-content">To mimic this behaviour in a load test script, we use Throughput Controller which controls how often
a particular scenario should be executed. And the controller contains 2 modes:</p>

load conditions. This will boost your confidence that the application is capable to handle the load
conditions before going LIVE.</p>
